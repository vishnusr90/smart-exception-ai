### Below is the list of some common exceptions that happen during payment processing.


1. Message: **payment-scoop**
   Tag: **payment scoop event**

    *Summary*:
    This is a new capability added into shopify that will help to extract a payment to downstream at scheduled interval of time.
    Application needs to insert a record in specified format in payment_scoop_traking_record which is being read by event-graph
    per minute to extract the payment.

    *Overview*:
        Payment scoop extraction is compirsed of two steps:
        - payment-scoop-schedule: event group describes polling frequency
        - payment-scoop-extract: event graph describes the payment extraction process

        payment-scoop-schedule:
        - Define (api-payment, payment-scoop)
        - Schedule (api-payment, payment-scoop) -> (UNRECOVERABLE: 0 */1 * * * *;America?New_York)

        payment-scoop-extract:
        - Define (api-payemnt, payment-scoop-extract-trigger) -> (api-payment, enrich-payment-instructions-count-and-amount) 
            ->(api-payment, enrich-payment-instructions-event-mapping) -> (file-import, pre-extract) -> (file-import, extract)

    *Mitigation Steps for resolution of issues*:
        - Login to event-ui: http://localhost:8080/event-ui/dashboard.
        - Navigate to event hierarchy section in "Events" tab and click it. Locate "sre-operations" -> sre-force-payment-scoop ->
            force-process-payment-scoop event.
        - Right click on force-process-payment-scoop and click on "Force Start Event".
        - Inspect the payment_scoop_tracking_record table for new entries. It should have status column set to "NEW".
        - Alternatively this can be spotted from event-ui.
            - Search for event instances of force-process-scoop-record from event ui within last 5 minutes.
            - Locate processing instruction ids from "process instructions" tab and search in event-ui screen.
            - payment-scoop-extract event graph can be located for payment group.
